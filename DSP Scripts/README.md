# Digital Signal Processing and Data Analysis Scripts (MATLAB)

This repository contains MATLAB scripts related to **digital signal processing (DSP)** and **data analysis techniques**, developed for educational purposes. The scripts cover DSP fundamentals, selected textbook-style exercises, and a larger project-based application. The textbook used is "Digital Audio Theory: A Practical Guide" by Christopher L. Bennett.

## Files Description

### `DSP_Basics.m`
Introduces **fundamental concepts of digital signal processing**.

**Description:**
- Demonstrates basic DSP operations and concepts
- May include:
  - Discrete-time signals
  - Signal visualization
  - Basic transformations and operations
- Intended as an introductory script for understanding DSP principles

**Purpose:**
- Build intuition for discrete-time signal behavior
- Serve as a foundation for more advanced DSP scripts

### `DAT_Ch2.m`
Script corresponding to **Chapter 2** material in a Data Analysis / DSP context.

**Description:**
- Implements concepts typically introduced early in DSP or data analysis courses
- May include:
  - Signal representation
  - Basic operations on discrete signals
  - Visualization of results
- Structured as a chapter-based exercise or example

**Purpose:**
- Reinforce theoretical concepts through MATLAB implementation
- Support coursework or textbook exercises

### `DAT_Ch10_Project.m`
Project-oriented script corresponding to **Chapter 10** material.

**Description:**
- Implements a more comprehensive DSP or data analysis task
- Combines multiple concepts learned throughout the course
- May include:
  - Signal processing pipelines
  - Analysis of real or simulated data
  - Interpretation and visualization of results

**Purpose:**
- Apply DSP and data analysis techniques in a project setting
- Demonstrate integration of multiple concepts

## Usage

Run any script directly from the MATLAB command window:

matlab
`DSP_Basics`
`DAT_Ch2`
`DAT_Ch10_Project`

## Software Requirements

- Base MATLAB
- Signal Processing Toolbox: `filtfilt()` and `freqz()` in `DAT_Ch10_Project.m`
- Signal Processing Toolbox `zplane()`,`freqz()`, and `spectrogram()` in `DSP_Basics.m`
